 * The accelerometer, on only while you are looking at the app.
 *
 * Registered from `onResume` and dropped in `onPause`, which is what keeps this from being a
 * battery question at all: a 50Hz stream costs real power, and there is no case where shaking a
 * phone that is showing something else should file a report against this app.
 *
 * The decision of what counts as a shake is in [ShakeGesture] and is plain arithmetic; this
 * class only turns three floats into a magnitude and hands it over.
