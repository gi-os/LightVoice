/**
 * A small offer in the corner, rather than a sheet across the screen.
 *
 * The first version of this raised the full sheet the instant you shook the phone, which was the
 * wrong shape for the question. A shake is a gesture the phone can misread, so the cost of being
 * wrong is paid *every* time it is wrong — and a sheet that covers what you were reading, on a
 * 3.92" screen, to ask about something you did not ask about, is a bad trade against a report that
 * might not even exist.
 *
 * So the offer is small, it sits out of the way, and **silence is an answer**: ignore it for four
 * seconds and it fades. Nothing is lost by ignoring it — an unsent crash log stays on disk and is
 * offered again on the next launch. Only the tap costs anything, and only the tap opens the sheet.
 *
 * Drawn in a [Popup] rather than placed in the app's layout. The host calls this as a sibling of
 * the app content, and the apps this package installs into put that sibling inside a Column, a
 * Box, a Surface or nothing at all — a `fillMaxSize` overlay would mean something different in
 * each. A popup has its own window, so bottom-start is bottom-start everywhere, and the chip
 * cannot take a touch that was meant for the app underneath it.
