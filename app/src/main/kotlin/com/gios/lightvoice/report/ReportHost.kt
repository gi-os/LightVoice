/**
 * The whole reporting feature, as one line in `MainActivity`.
 *
 * A sibling of the app's content rather than a wrapper around it. The sheet is a
 * `ModalBottomSheet`, which renders in its own window, so it does not need to contain anything
 * to sit on top of everything — and a call that does not wrap means installing this in a new
 * app is inserting one line inside the theme, with no re-indentation and no brace to move.
 * Everything it owns — the sensor, the crash file, the queue — is tied to the composition and
 * to the lifecycle, so an app that stops calling it stops paying for it.
 *
 * Nothing here opens the sheet on its own. Three things can raise the *offer* — a chip in the
 * corner — and only a tap on that chip opens the sheet. They are deliberately different questions:
 *
 *  - **A shake.** You noticed something. The gesture is in [ShakeGesture] and is tuned to be
 *    hard to trigger in a pocket.
 *  - **A crash last run.** The app died and left a stack trace behind. Asked once, on the
 *    launch after, because that is the only moment the trace is still worth anything.
 *  - **A failure the app noticed itself.** See [Trouble] — the quiet ones, which are the
 *    reports that otherwise never get filed.
 *
 * The sensor is registered on RESUME and dropped on PAUSE. That is what keeps a 50Hz
 * accelerometer stream from being a battery question: it only runs while you are looking at
 * the app, and shaking a phone that is showing something else has nothing to do with this one.
