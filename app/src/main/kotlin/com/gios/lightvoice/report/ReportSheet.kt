/**
 * What went wrong, once you have said you want to tell somebody.
 *
 * **Deliberately self-contained.** The version of this in LightCamera leans on that app's own
 * `LightChip`, `LightWideButton`, `LightListRow` and theme tokens, which is why it has never
 * moved anywhere else — no two Light apps share a UI vocabulary. Everything visual below is
 * private to this file and built from plain Compose plus `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, so the
 * whole `report/` package drops into any app with nothing changed but the package line.
 *
 * The greys are the LightOS three — background, content, contentSecondary — read from the host
 * app's own colour scheme where possible so a sheet in a light-themed app is not a black hole.
 *
 * It assumes typing on this phone is expensive: a chip is a complete report on its own, and the
 * note is optional. But the note is also the only part that carries anything the build table
 * cannot — "standings empty for the WNBA" is a bug, "Something looks wrong" is a shrug — so it
 * takes the headline in the issue title whenever it is filled in.
