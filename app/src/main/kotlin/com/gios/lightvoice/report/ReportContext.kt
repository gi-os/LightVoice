 * package line, which is the point — the reporting feature was stuck inside LightCamera for
 * months because it was woven through that app's own UI. Keeping the per-app strings here means
 * porting it is a copy plus three edits, and means a fix to the queue or the gesture can be
 * applied everywhere the same way.
