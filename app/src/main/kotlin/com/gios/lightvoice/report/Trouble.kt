 * ordinary never arrive at all. This app is mostly a reader of other people's score feeds, so
 * the quiet failure — a provider that started returning an empty array — is the common one.
 *
 * **The nagging is the thing to get right.** A feed that cannot be reached fails on every
 * refresh, and an app that asks to report it twelve times before lunch gets its reporting turned
 * off. So the same failure asks once an hour at most.
