/**
 * The shake gesture, on the JVM.
 *
 * This is the half of shake-to-report that decides whether anything happens at all, and it is
 * the half that cannot be tested on the phone in any repeatable way — you cannot shake a device
 * the same way twice. Keeping it free of Android imports is what makes these possible, and is
 * the reason the class is shaped the way it is.
 *
 * Samples arrive at 50Hz on the real device, so the 20ms steps below are the real cadence.
